# MemMap

Using `mmap2` to memory-map files can significantly improve performance when working with large files. Memory mapping allows you to access file contents directly in memory, reducing the need for explicit read and write operations.

In Rust, you can use the `memmap` crate to easily work with memory-mapped files. This crate provides a safe and ergonomic API for creating memory-mapped regions, allowing you to read and write to files as if they were in-memory arrays.

Here's a simple example of using `memmap` to memory-map a file:

```rust
use memmap::MmapOptions;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let file = File::open("large_file.txt")?;
    let mmap = unsafe { MmapOptions::new().map(&file)? };

    // Now you can access the file contents as a slice
    let contents = &mmap[..];
    println!("File contents: {}", std::str::from_utf8(contents).unwrap());

    Ok(())
}
```

By using memory mapping, you can achieve better performance and lower memory usage when working with large files in Rust.

It can be especially useful when you need random access to different parts of a large file, as the operating system will handle loading the necessary pages into memory as needed.
