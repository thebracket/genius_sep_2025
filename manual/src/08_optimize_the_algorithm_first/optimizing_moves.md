# Optimizing Moves

In Rust, moves are a fundamental part of the ownership system. When you move a value, you transfer ownership of that value from one variable to another. This is different from languages like C++ or Java, where assignment creates copies of values by default.

Moves can be optimized in several ways:
- **Avoiding unnecessary moves**: If you don't need to move a value, you can borrow it instead. This is done using references (`&T` for immutable references and `&mut T` for mutable references). Borrowing allows you to access a value without taking ownership of it, which can be more efficient.
- **Using `Copy` types**: Some types in Rust implement the `Copy` trait, which means that they can be copied instead of moved. This is true for simple types like integers and booleans, as well as for types that are made up of `Copy` types.
- **Using smart pointers**: Smart pointers like `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` can be used to manage ownership of heap-allocated values. These types allow you to share ownership of a value without moving it, which can be more efficient in some cases.

For example, I recently had a program that was moving large amounts of data over channels. Wrapping the data in a `Box` *massively* sped up the program - you just move the pointer, not the contents.
