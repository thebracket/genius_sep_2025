# Wrap Up: Traits and Generics

Traits and generics are very powerful tools in Rust. They tend to be more useful on the *library* side of things---writing generic code for others to consume. But they can also be useful in application code, especially when you want to enforce certain patterns (like type state patterns) or write code that works with multiple types without duplicating code.
